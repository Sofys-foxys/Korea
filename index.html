                <p>Hi! I am the girl behind this small landingpage and you are about to discover my adventures in South Korea!
                    But first let me tell you a little bit more about me: I am a student of Graphic Design, thus why I am making this 
                    pageâ€”for my programming class. Knowing this, why did I chose Korea? I believe Korea is a wonderful country
                    and I had the fortune to visit it twiceâ€”one in 2023 and another in 2024 both as a turist and as an exchange student. 
                    And I wanted to share a little bit about my experience and favourite places with you. Enjoy! And please, 
                    visit Korea.

                <h2>From my eyes</h2>
                <p>It's true that I learned first about Korea thorugh k-dramas and k-pop. But as time went I started
                    dwelving a little bit deeper into their culture, traditions and history. And what a lucky gal I am
                    that Korea is famours for having lots of "open museums" such as Hahoe, Andong, Suwon and Gyeongjuâ€”my
                    favourite place! Each of these places hold memories of the Joseon and Silla Dinasty! Korea is also called
                    "The Land of the morning calm" as the chinese name of Joseon can be interpreted in that way. Which is no
                    surprise since Korea has plenty of gardensâ€”Garden of the morning calm, Nami Island,Spirited Gardenâ€”, and
                    it's known for their trekking mountains. There is so much to see in Korea that is not limited to pop,
                    skincare and others. Not saying it's wrong to go there just for thatâ€”only that if you are already There, 
                    why not explore more?

                <p>I definitely had a blast. I met so many wonderful people from some many different countries. Learned so much about life abroud and independenceâ€”specially
                    when you have to do bank papers when you don't know the language...don't recommend hahaha. The friends I met, even if we had some language barriers, are friends
                    with which I share so many fond memories and I know that I have a place to return to when I go back. It's true that academically speaking I didn't do much as a 
                    graphic designer, but the experience, the different perspective and being able to keep my eyes open all the time to new wonders...I already knew at that time that I was living
                    the memories I will go back to for my life. While I love Korea, and will love for you to give it a chance. My fondness doesn't come from Korea as a countryâ€”rather as a scenery
                    in where I had some of my most joyous times. It wasn't perfect by any means, more like bitersweet. I hope for you to explore, maybe is by going to new sceneries you will life great experiences.
                    PD: I didn't include pictures of my friends since: privacy haha. Still, I hope you like the images!
